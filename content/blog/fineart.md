Among the good data people I know, there is only one thing that seems universal. Every one of them is constantly curious. They want to learn knew things. What should I learn next? Python? R? SQL? Multilevel modeling? Bayesian models? Simulations? TensorFlow? 

You know what never makes the list? Art. 

That's a shame. While getting a degree in fine art, I was explicitly taught and had to practice a number of skills that are directly applicable and useful.

Some of it is practical, things like Project Management and problem solving. Of course, you don't have to learn art to learn these things. But data analysis is a creative endeavour, filled with judgements and choices and decisions.

If you've ever been involved with making even the smallest film, there is a path you have followed. 

You have to convince people that your idea is the best use of their resources (time, money, skill, equipment). You need to create a series of steps to get from concept to product. To do that, you have to collect a bunch of people with very different skills and knowledge, explain what you're trying to do, and get the best parts out of each of them, even though most of them have no idea what the end result is going to look like. You end up with something. You show it to people. They react. You make changes. You show it to them again. 

And in the middle of that process, you run into a whole pile of obstacles. 
I don't have x. What other thing can I use that is a plausible stand-in for x? 

I thought I was going to be able to get x, but now I can't.



The thing about making art is, at every step, after each decision, you know that it's not perfect. You could touch up a few parts, you could record another take, you could adjust the lighting and shoot it again, you could try a different angle, you could try different blocking. You badly want to do that. You know that what you are looking at is less than it could be. The thing in your mind is bright and clear and beautiful. The thing on the screen or the page or the canvas or the stage or the tape is kind of murky, a little muted. But you also know that you have a deadline, or even if you don't you have other ideas, and every minute you spend editing is a minute stolen from the next idea. You also know that you're playing a game that's a little like Jenga, where every tiny thing you change might just be the thing that wrecks your project, and sometimes there's no fixing it.

So you get really good at knowing when to quit. And you get comfortable with looking at stuff you did and knowing there were choices you made with the constraints you had. You also learn to recognize you're better and different now than you were back then, and to not cringe too much at your old stuff. 


Storytelling:
There is something you want to tell someone. There is a whole bunch of background and context and character development you need to get through before the payoff. How do you sequence that? How do you keep them awake, even interested? A whole pile of powerpoint slides with background info slowly building on each other until you have the critical mass of info you need for your last slide to make sense? Good luck with that. 

Storyboarding.

Aesthetics
The importance of good design. How colour works. How light works. How to frame a photograph. The golden ratio. The rule of thirds. Aspect ratios. Timing. 

When you know a lot about something, and you're explaining it to people who don't speak the same language, you'll save a lot of frustration on both sides by using pictures. 

Aesthetics are important. Attention to detail is important. Design is important. Evidence of impact of aesthetics. If your chart is ugly, or has that "default" look, if the axes are labelled with raw variable names, or unformatted numbers, you're transmitting a message. The message? Did you put as much care into the analysis as you did into these charts? Did you put the same amount of effort into the work as you did into this presentation? It may be unfair, but it's true. Competence is assessed based on what they see, not what you did. Part of a book is judged by its cover. Back when physical media was a thing, there were definitely albums I was interested in because of the cover (example). There were definitely albums I was suprised were good despite their cover. (Butthole Surfers: Eletriclarryland)

That brings us to the most important thing of all...

Audience:
Implicit in any production of art is the concept of an audience. As an artist you may be trying to please an audience. You may be trying to piss off an audience. You may be trying to surprise an audience. You may be trying to make an audience laugh, or cry, or throw up. Whatever the case, there is always part of you that's thinking about the audience, what they want, and whether you want to give it to them. 

You're trying to take something that's hard to explain, and make them understand. You are trying to reveal a deeper truth. Art is communication. Data analysis is communication. 


Perspective is always good
